<p>AITBank has 4 account types, which need to be used with the system.
Saving accounts
Cheque accounts
Net-saver accounts
Fixed accounts</p>

<p>Saving account offer interest, which calculated daily, and Net-saver account offer higher interest than Saving, which calculated monthly. Cheque account does not offer any interest, but it does not have daily withdrawal limit same as Fixed account, which calculated base on contract period. However, customer who withdraws from Fixed account before the due date, will not get any interest. 
Daily withdrawal limit for saving account can be customize for each customer. 
In addition, ATMs machine can give only 20, 50 and 100 notes.</p>

<p>Task A
Design a series of abstract data types (ATDs) to model the above transaction processing system. Implement your ADT designs using Java.</p>

<p>Note: Remember that your classes should only model the data, transactions and business logic of the bank and NOT the interface.</p>

<p>Task B
Create a set of concrete classes to demonstrate the abstract data types are working properly. Note: State clearly any assumptions you make.</p>
